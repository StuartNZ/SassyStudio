# SassyStudio
=================

SassyStudio provides a small amount of integration with Visual Studio to the experience using
SASS / SCSS a bit friendlier. Here's what we provide so far:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Outlining

In the near future I am planning to add support for the following (assuming VS/Web team doesn't add it first):

- CSS Editor integration to get intellisense / syntax highlighting support
- Intellisense support so you can get completion for variable names, function names, mixins, css classes, etc
- File generation so that when you save or build it will compile a css file
- Error / warning integration
- Multiline comments


### Release Notes

**v0.1**
- Basic Syntax Highlighting Support
- Basic Outlining Support 

**v0.2** 
- Match Existing Color Settings
